        <br /><br />

        Functional Cookies
        <ul>
            <li>These cookies are necessary for you to browse the website and use the services and main features. For
            example,
            a cookie that remembers the country or language you have selected. They are essential for our website to
            function technically and cannot be switched off in our systems.</li>
            <li>They do not store any personally identifiable information and the information collected is not used for
            marketing purposes.</li>
            <li>Their installation does not require the user’s permission or consent.</li>
        </ul>
        Performance/Analytical cookies
        <ul>
            <li>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources.</li>
            <li>They help us know how you use the website, notably time spent on each page and the number of visits per
            page,
            error messages shown and clicks in certain areas of the website so we can measure and improve the
            performance of
            the website.</li>
            <li>If you do not allow these cookies, we will be less able to optimize our website performance.</li>
            <li>All information these cookies collect is aggregated, anonymous and cannot be used for marketing purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        Marketing cookies

            <li>Measurement Cookies:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>These cookies are used for limited website statistics and audience measurement. They enable us to
                track the
                effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</li>
                <li>With these cookies we count and analyze the number of leads and clicks associated with our marketing
                investments.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>These cookies are set through our website by us or by third parties to build a profile of your
                interests. They
                help us show you relevant content or adverts on our website that consider your preferences.</li>
                <li>If the device is shared by several people, the person receiving the emails or viewing the
                promotional content
                may not be the person who conducted the search. They do not store directly personal information but
                are based on
                uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.</li>
                <li>If you do not allow these cookies, you may experience less personalized content and/or
                advertising.</li>
